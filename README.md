Lockerroom Buzz
---------------

This is a more complex app than the login app.

It runs on the express server as the backend
server and the react server as the frontend server.

It uses bootstrap css for design on the html parts.

It is currently incomplete. It needs to connect to routes within the backend
server for user authentication in the login form and it needs to be able to
sign up new users upon request.
